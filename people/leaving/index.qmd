# Things to do if you are leaving the lab

Leaving can be sad. In addition, there is a ton of boring admin work to be done.

## Papers

-   [ ] Make sure all published papers are entered into the Forschungsportal

-   [ ] Make sure all revised manuscript versions and published papers are updated on biorXiv, psyarXiv, medarXiv preprint servers

## Admin

-   [ ] Return your key to Chrissy once you don't need a desk
-   [ ] Extend your UGOnline account if needed

## Data

-   [ ] Make sure that all subject's private data that is irrelevant for research (e.g. bank account information for reimbursement) is deleted from the server, from local institute's computers and from your private computer if relevant
-   [ ] Make sure that all incidental findings have been clarified, and once this is the case, delete subjects' contact information if you kept it
-   [ ] At the top level of your directory on /storage, create a text/markdown file named "projects" containing server paths (/storage/, J:, or external storage in the case of MW) as follows in the example below
-   [ ] It would be nice if you could put a contact email for after your uni-graz email address expires (optional, of course) at the top of this file

1.  project nickname

2.  Final version (from the MRI/behavioral lab) of the stimulus script

3.  Raw data (whichever applies)

    a.  behavioral
    b.  eyetracking
    c.  physiology
    d.  (f)MRI
    e.  pdf of the MRI protocol

4.  Subject-level analysis scripts (including preprocessing)

5.  Subject-level results

6.  Group analysis scripts

7.  Group results

8.  Latest version of the submitted manuscript with rebuttal, if applicable. For master students: your UGOnline submitted thesis, preferably in word format

9.  Posters and submitted conference abstracts related to the study

10. Location of the consent forms (either electronic or paper)

    ### Example:

`/storage/natalia/projects.md`

For neurodesk users, the projects file can be in your home directory:

```         
/home/jovyan/
```

#### Fast and functionally specific cortical thickness changes induced by visual stimulation

1.  project nickname: hexcite
2.  stimulus script: #todo
3.  Raw data
    -   bahavior: `/storage/nv_shared/projects/excitex/matfiles/`
    -   MRI: `/storage/nv_shared/projects/excitex/bids/`
    -   PDF of the MRI protocol: `/storage/nv_shared/projects/excitex/111_NZ03_excite_autoalign.pdf`
4.  First level analysis scripts (including preprocessing): `/storage/natalia/projects/hexcite/analyze_hexcite_struc_R1.sh`, `/storage/natalia/projects/hexcite/analyze_hexcite_fmri.sh`
5.  Subject-level results `/storage/natalia/projects/hexcite/bids/derivatives/`
6.  Group analysis scripts `/storage/natalia/projects/hexcite/bids/code/analyze_hexcite_final.m`
7.  Group results: `/storage/natalia/projects/hexcite/group_lowres/`
8.  Latest version of the submitted manuscript with rebuttal: `/storage/natalia/projects/hexcite/manuscript/hexcite_CerCor_R1`
9.  Posters and submitted conference abstracts related to the study `/storage/natalia/projects/hexcite/presentations`
10. Paper - Corner office, rightmost drawer
