## Ensure Defacing!

Defacing your T1w scans is an important preprocessing step *that has to be done before* [running fmriprep](run_fmriprep.qmd) as you´ll probably run into errors otherwise!
:::

# General Information

When we acquired data "ourselves", we definetely have to deface the T1w-scan ([after converting the DICOMs to niftis](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd)) before we can continue!

When acquiring data during regular scanner times, we already get nifti files. There should be a directory `rawdata`, which contains the data in BIDS-Format. Additionally there is a directory `faced`.

In theory, the directory `faced` should contain the original T1w-niftis that you can [send to the participant](ProvidingParticipantsWithTheirT1wFile.qmd) and the T1w-niftis within `rawdata` should already be defaced (and thus be ready to further work with them, e.g. [fmriprep](run_fmriprep.qmd)).

However, sometimes the automatic defacing at the MRI-Lab does not work as intended, potentially resulting in "non-defaced" T1w-niftis in the `rawdata` directory! Thus, you should *always* check the T1w-nifti in `rawdata` to ensure that it is defaced and avoid potential subsequent problems.

## Don´t forget your participants!

If you [promised participants that they´ll get their T1w scan](ProvidingParticipantsWithTheirT1wFile.qmd): When the data was acquired outside the regular scanning times (i.e. we start with the DICOMs), make sure to save the T1w-nifti once separately before defacing!

# Defacing your T1w-Scan

## Start Pydeface (v.2.0.2) {#sec-startPydeface}

To deface your t1w, you first have to open `pydeface`:

1.  Click on the Birds-Symbol at the bottom left

2.  Hover `Neurodesk`

3.  Hover `All Applications`

4.  Scroll down until you find `pydeface`

5.  Click on `pydeface 2.0.2` ![Pydeface 2.0.2](./images/03_Defacing/01_open_Pydeface.png)

After it opens, it may need some time to load everything - be patient!

Finally, it should look like this: ![Pydeface Started](./images/03_Defacing/02_pydeface_opened.png)

## Get the path to your original T1w scan

1.  Navigate to the anatomical scan of the participant within your [BIDS](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd) directory

2.  Right-click on the anatomical nifti file

3.  Select \`Copy Path(s) ![Get Path(s) of anat-scan](./images/03_Defacing/03_Path_to_T1w.png)

## The pydeface command

1.  Go back to the terminal window, where pydeface is loaded ([or start it again](#sec-startPydeface))

2.  Type `pydeface`

3.  Enter the path to your T1w scan (right-click + `paste` or type in the path)

4.  Type `--outfile`

5.  Repeat Step 3 (with this approach, you "overwrite" the initial T1w with the then defaced T1w file)

6.  Type `--force`

It should look like this: ![Pydeface Command](./images/03_Defacing/04_pydeface_command.png)

```         
pydeface /home/jovyan/Website/bids/sub-999/ses-1/anat/sub-999_ses-1_T1w.nii.gz --outfile /home/jovyan/Website/bids/sub-999/ses-1/anat/sub-999_ses-1_T1w.nii.gz --force
```

Then, press enter. Again, it might take a few moments, until pydeface finishes, be patient! At the end, it should look like this: ![Pydeface Finished](./images/03_Defacing/05_defacing_finished.png)

## The next steps

Congratulations, you successfully defaced a T1w-scan and you are one step closer to analyzing your data!

To continue in your journey to your Analysis, please return to the [Overview-Page](Overview_fromDICOMtoGLM.qmd) to check what to do next.

Alternatively, here is a list of potential next steps to continue with

1. [Provide Participants their T1w file](ProvidingParticipantsWithTheirT1wFile.qmd)

2.  [Remove Denoising Scans from your data?](RemoveDenoisingScan.qmd)

3. [Check the IntendedFor field of the fmap](check_IntendedFor_field.qmd)

4.  [run fmriprep](run_fmriprep.qmd)
