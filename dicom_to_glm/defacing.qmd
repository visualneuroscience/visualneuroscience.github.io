# General Information

When we acquired data "ourselves" (and start with the dicom files), we have to deface the T1w-scan! (When we get our data from the MRI-Lab, it will already be defaced)

To deface your T1w-scan, you first need a T1w nifti file! If you currently have DICOM files, you have to [convert them to nifti's first](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd)!

**Defacing you T1w scans is an important preprocessing step *that has to be done before* [running fmriprep](run_fmriprep.qmd). If you run fmriprep without prior defacing, you´ll probably run into errors!**

*Important* (if you [promised participants that they´ll get their T1w scan](ProvidingParticipantsWithTheirT1wFile.qmd)): Since we get already defaced images when not testing ourselves, every participant only gets the defaced T1w-scans. Thus, you have to do the defacing *before* sending the file to your participant!

# Defacing your T1w-Scan

## Start Pydeface (v.2.0.2) {#sec-startPydeface}

To deface your t1w, you first have to open `pydeface`:

1.  Click on the Birds-Symbol at the bottom left

2.  Hover `Neurodesk`

3.  Hover `All Applications`

4.  Scroll down until you find `pydeface`

5.  Click on `pydeface 2.0.2` ![Pydeface 2.0.2](./images/03_Defacing/01_open_Pydeface.png)

After it opens, it may need some time to load everything - be patient!

Finally, it should look like this: ![Pydeface Started](./images/03_Defacing/02_pydeface_opened.png)

## Get the path to your original T1w scan

1.  Navigate to the anatomical scan of the participant within your [BIDS](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd) directory

2.  Right-click on the anatomical nifti file

3.  Select \`Copy Path(s) ![Get Path(s) of anat-scan](./images/03_Defacing/03_Path_to_T1w.png)

## The pydeface command

1.  Go back to the terminal window, where pydeface is loaded ([or start it again](#sec-startPydeface))

2.  Type `pydeface`

3.  Enter the path to your T1w scan (right-click + `paste` or type in the path)

4.  Type `--outfile`

5.  Repeat Step 3 (with this approach, you "overwrite" the initial T1w with the then defaced T1w file)

6.  Type `--force`

It should look like this: ![Pydeface Command](./images/03_Defacing/04_pydeface_command.png)

```         
pydeface /home/jovyan/Website/bids/sub-999/ses-1/anat/sub-999_ses-1_T1w.nii.gz --outfile /home/jovyan/Website/bids/sub-999/ses-1/anat/sub-999_ses-1_T1w.nii.gz --force
```

Then, press enter. Again, it might take a few moments, until pydeface finishes, be patient! At the end, it should look like this: ![Pydeface Finished](./images/03_Defacing/05_defacing_finished.png)

## The next steps

Congratulations, you successfully defaced a T1w-scan and you are one step closer to analyzing your data!

To continue in your journey to your Analysis, please return to the [Overview-Page](Overview_fromDICOMtoGLM.qmd) to check what to do next.

Alternatively, here is a list of potential next steps to continue with

1.  [Remove Denoising Scans from your data?](RemoveDenoisingScan.qmd)

2.  [run fmriprep](run_fmriprep.qmd)
