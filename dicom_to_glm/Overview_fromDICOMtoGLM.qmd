# General

This page gives an overview and brief information about the necessary steps to get from the DICOM files to a GLM Analysis. You can find more detailed information by navigating to the sub-pages by clicking on the caption of the respective point.

# DICOM-Files

-   the raw files from the scanner are DICOM-Files
-   not really useful since we need `.nifti` files for our analysis $\qquad\to$ first step is to transform the `DICOM`- to `.nift`-files

# [DICOM to nifti](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd)

-   using a script from Adam that can be [found here](https://github.com/adam-coates/dicom2bids) (or here: `/shared/dcm2bids.sh`)
-   results in `.nifti` files in [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html) format

# [Check the "IntendedFor" entry of the fmap's JSON file](check_IntendedFor_field.qmd)

-   depending on what method you used to [convert your DICOMs to niftis](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd) (or if you got a bids valid data from the MRI-Lab) and what version of [fmriPrep](run_fmriprep.qmd) you plan to use, it might be necessary to update the content of the "IntendedFor" field of the fmap's JSON file

# [Distribute the T1w files to participants?](ProvidingParticipantsWithTheirT1wFile.qmd)

-   if you promised participants that they will get their T1w images, you should make sure that they really get them
-   this should be done before [defacing](defacing.qmd)

# [Defacing your data](defacing.qmd)

-   $\bf{You\ have\ to\ deface\ your\ data\ before\ running\ fmriprep\ or\ your\ analysis!!!!!}$
-   You may want to save the "non-defaced" files somewhere else to give them to your participants
-   You should delete the "non-defaced" files either after you distributed them to the respective participants, or after your study ended
-   NEVER share data that was not defaced before!
-   Defacing is done with `pydeface` (Docker; Version 2.0.2)

# ([Remove denoising scan from your data](RemoveDenoisingScan.qmd))

-   if a denoising sequence was used in the scanner, but you don´t use denoising in your analysis, you have to remove the last volume of each scan (which basically is a noise scan) before continuing

# [fmriprep](run_fmriprep.qmd)

-   this is one of many [BIDS-Apps](https://bids.neuroimaging.io//tools/bids-apps.html) (that require [a BIDS-valid Dataset](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/))
-   runs various preprocessing steps on it´s own

# [first-level Analysis](first_level_glm_nilearn.qmd)

# [second-level Analysis](second_level_glm_nilearn.qmd)
