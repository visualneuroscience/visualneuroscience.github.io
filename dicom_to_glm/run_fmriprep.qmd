fMRIprep is a helpful and stardardized preprocessing tool/pipeline for BIDS-valid datsets. By combining various neuroimaging software packages (FSL, ANTs, FreeSurfer,...) it allows us to run various preprocessing steps automatically:

1.  Anatomical (T1w) preprocessing
    -   Bias field correction
    -   Skull stripping
    -   Surface reconstruction
    -   Spatial normalization
    -   Tissue segmentation
2.  Functional (BOLD) preprocessing
    -   Slice time correction
    -   Motion correction
    -   Susceptibility distortion correction
    -   Co-registration
    -   Spatial normalization
    -   Brain masking
    -   Confound estimation
    -   Resampling

# Before running fMRIprep {#sec-NecessitiesFmriprep}

Before you start fMRIprep, you have to make sure, that you:

1.  [have nifti files in BIDS format](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd)

2.  [defaced your anatomical scans](defacing.qmd)

3.  [Optional: removed the noise scans from your functional data](RemoveNoiseScan.qmd)

4.  [Check the IntendedFor field of the fmaps JSON file](check_IntendedFor_field.qmd)

# Running fMRIprep step by step

## Starting fMRIprep {#sec-fmriprepStart}

To start fMRIprep, click on the bird symbol at the bottom left on neurodesk, hover `neurodesk`, then `All applications` and navigate to `fmriprep`. Select the version that you want to use ![Starting fMRIprep](./images/04_fmriprep/00_OpenFmriprep.png)

After selecting your version, a new `bash` window opens and fMRIprep loads. This can take a few moments, be patient! When everything is ready, the bottom line should state `fmriprep-"Version"` (with "Version" being whatever version you selected, for example `fmriprep-24.1.1`) ![fMRIprep is ready](./images/04_fmriprep/01_fmriprepReady.png)

## Setting up necessary directories and defining "SUBJECTS_DIR" {#sec-fmriprepSetup}

First, you need to create some new directories that are necessary for fMRIprep to run properly. For this, enter the following command (adapt the path(s)!)

``` bash
mkdir -p /home/jovyan/website/bids/derivatives/fmriprep/sourcedata/freesurfer/
```

By confirming your command with Enter, you´ll find the new directory structure within you derivatives directory![New Directories](./images/04_fmriprep/02_newDirectories.png)

Then, we need to specify where fMRIprep should store the resulting files with this command (again, adapt the path(s) if necessary):

``` {.bash .copy-code}
SUBJECTS_DIR=/home/jovyan/website/bids/derivatives/fmriprep/sourcedata/freesurfer/
```

![Set SUBJECTS_DIR](./images/04_fmriprep/03_setSUBJECTS_DIR.png)

**Hint:** you can copy/paste both commands from above and execute them by pressing enter simultaneously, it doesn´t matter

## fmriprep command {#sec-fmriprepCommand}

With the setup done, you can now run the command (for more information about the commands/flag, please refer to the [fMRIprep documentation](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/usage.html):

``` {.bash .copy-code}
fmriprep /home/jovyan/website/bids /home/jovyan/website/bids/derivatives/fmriprep participant --bold2t1w-init header --force-bbr -w /home/jovyan/website/fmriprep_tmp --output-spaces T1w fsaverage fsnative --participant-label sub-999 --nprocs 8 --mem 10000 --skip_bids_validation --stop-on-first-crash -v --fs-license-file /home/jovyan/website/freesurferlicense/license.txt
```

**Important:** adapt the flag `--participant-label sub-999` accordingly, so that you state the subject you want to preprocess

**Hint:** same as before, you could run this command with the two commands above for the setup as well. The only important thing is the order: first the command for making the directories, then defining `SUBJECTS_DIR`and finally the fMRIprep command.

## Waiting

After fMRIprep started, it´s probably time to get a coffee and do something else. This process will take quite some time (hours), you don´t have to stare at the output the whole time. You can also close the Tab where you opened neurodesk! Even if you close it, the program continues its work as your server keeps running!

# Running fMRIprep with a script

Especially if you want to process multiple subjects, it can be useful to run fMRIprep using a `bash` script, as you can loop through the subjects without having to start the process manually every time.

You can see an example script to achieve this below (which is also available at `/shared/website/run_fmriprep.sh`). To adapt this to your needs, you have to:

1.  Adapt the structure to the subjects (and their "naming") you want to process: change the instances of `sub-1400` and the entries in the variable `participant_labels` to match your data

    $\to$ in this case, the data of every subject is (according to BIDS) in a subdirectory. The name of these directories always start with `sub-1400` with the last to digits differing between subjects. In every iteration of the for-loop, the corresponding entry of the list in `participant_labels` (which always is a 2-digit number) is the value for `label`. This value is substituted for `$label` everywhere within the loop, e.g. resulting in `sub-140001` in the first iteration, `sub-140002` in the second iteration, and so on.

2.  Adapt the line `ml fmriprep/23.0.0`: you can select any version of fMRIprep that is available on neurodesk (see @sec-fmriprepStart for how to check which version are available). If you want to use a different version, you have to use Singularity (you need a singularity image and basically replace the word `fmriprep` in the command with `singularity run --cleanenv /Path/to/fmriprep-<<Version>>.simg`; [see the documentation](https://fmriprep.org/en/1.1.4/installation.html)

3.  Adapt the path to your data (and the building of the corresponding necessary directories)

``` {.bash .copy-code}
participant_labels=(01 02 03 04 05)

ml fmriprep/23.0.0

mkdir -p /home/jovyan/thesis_data/bids/derivatives/fmriprep/sourcedata/freesurfer/
SUBJECTS_DIR=/home/jovyan/thesis_data/bids/derivatives/fmriprep/sourcedata/freesurfer/

export SINGULARITYENV_SUBJECTS_DIR=$SUBJECTS_DIR
export APPTAINERENV_SUBJECTS_DIR=$SUBJECTS_DIR

for label in "${participant_labels[@]}"; do
    fmriprep /home/jovyan/thesis_data/bids /home/jovyan/thesis_data/bids/derivatives/fmriprep participant --bold2t1w-init header -w /home/jovyan/thesis_data/fmriprep_tmp/sub-1400$label --output-spaces T1w fsaverage fsnative --participant-label sub-1400$label --nprocs 8 --mem 20000 --skip_bids_validation --stop-on-first-crash -v --fs-license-file /home/jovyan/completion/freesurferlicense/license.txt
done
```

Keep in mind, that with running fMRIprep for multiple subjects subsequently, the runtime scales with the number of subjects. Be aware of potential server restarts and other running processes!
