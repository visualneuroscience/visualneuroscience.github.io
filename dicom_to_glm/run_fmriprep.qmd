# Before running fmriprep {#sec-NecessitiesFmriprep}

Before you start fmriprep, you have to make sure, that you:

1.  [have nifti files in BIDS format](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd)

2.  [defaced your anatomical scans](defacing.qmd)

3.  [Optional: removed the noise scans from your functional data](RemoveDenoisingScan.qmd)

4.  [Optional: adapted the "IntendedFor" section in the fmap's .json file (if you want to use fmriprep 24.0.0 or newer)](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd#sec-IntendedFor)

# Starting fmriprep {#sec-fmriprepStart}

To start fmriprep, click on the bird symbol at the bottom left on neurodesk, hover `neurodesk`, then `All applications` and navigate to `fmriprep`. Select the version of fmriprep that you want to use ![Starting fmriprep](./images/04_fmriprep/00_OpenFmriprep.png)

After selecting your version, a new `bash` window opens and fmriprep loads. This can take a few moments, be patient! When everything is ready, the bottom line should state `fmriprep-"Version"` (with "Version" being whatever version you selected, for example `fmriprep-24.1.1`) ![fmriprep is ready](./images/04_fmriprep/01_fmriprepReady.png)

# Setting up necessary directories and defining "SUBJECTS_DIR" {#sec-fmriprepSetup}

First, you need to create some new directories that are necessary for fmriprep to run properly. For this, enter the following command (adapt the path(s) if necessary)

``` bash         
mkdir -p /home/jovyan/website/bids/derivatives/fmriprep/sourcedata/freesurfer/
```

By confirming your command with Enter, you´ll find the new directory structure within you derivatives directory![New Directories](./images/04_fmriprep/02_newDirectories.png)

Then, we need to specify where fmriprep should store the resulting files with this command (again, adapt the path(s) if necessary):

``` bash         
SUBJECTS_DIR=/home/jovyan/website/bids/derivatives/fmriprep/sourcedata/freesurfer/
```

![Set SUBJECTS_DIR](./images/04_fmriprep/03_setSUBJECTS_DIR.png)

**Hint:** you can copy/paste both commands from above and execute them by pressing enter simultaneously, it doesn´t matter

# fmriprep command {#sec-fmriprepCommand}

With the setup done, you can now run the command:

``` bash         
fmriprep /home/jovyan/website/bids /home/jovyan/website/bids/derivatives/fmriprep participant --bold2t1w-init header --force-bbr -w /home/jovyan/website/fmriprep_tmp --output-spaces T1w fsaverage fsnative --participant-label sub-999 --nprocs 8 --mem 10000 --skip_bids_validation --stop-on-first-crash -v --fs-license-file /home/jovyan/website/freesurferlicense/license.txt
```

**Important:** adapt the flag `--participant-label sub-999` accordingly, so that you state the subject you want to preprocess

**Hint:** same as before, you could run this command with the two commands above for the setup as well. The only important thing is the order: first the command for making the directories, then defining `SUBJECTS_DIR`and finally the fmriprep command.

# Waiting

When fmriprep started, now it´s probably time to get a coffee and do something else. This process will take quite some time (hours), you don´t have to stare at the output the whole time. You can also close the Tab where you opened neurodesk! Even if you close it, the program continues its work!

# Troubleshooting

$\to$ If there are any problems, please refer to the dedicated [troubleshooting page](troubleshooting.qmd#sec-TroublesFmriprep)

1.  I ran fMRIprep but no distortion correction happened

    > fMRIprep might be using an outdated BIDS specification. Here this is related to the fmap `json` file. See [Information about BIDS uri](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common-principles.html#bids-uri), or the [corresponding wiki entry](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd#sec-IntendedFor).

    -   If your fmap .json file is using the BIDS uri specification in the `IntendedFor` field and you are using an older fMRIprep version then this will need to be changed to the older path specification e.g.

    BIDS uri spec for fmriprep 24.0.0 or newer:

    ``` json
    "IntendedFor": [
        "bids::sub-1181001/ses-1/func/sub-1181001_ses-1_task-movie_run-1_bold.nii.gz",
        "bids::sub-1181001/ses-1/func/sub-1181001_ses-1_task-movie_run-2_bold.nii.gz", 
        etc
        ]
    ```

    Older fmap spec for fmriprep older than 24.0.0:

    ``` json
    "IntendedFor": [
        "ses-1/func/sub-1181001_ses-1_task-movie_run-1_bold.nii.gz",
        "ses-1/func/sub-1181001_ses-1_task-movie_run-2_bold.nii.gz",
        etc
        ]
    ```

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

2.  I ran fMRIprep and the distortion correction of the data is too extreme

<center>

![An example of poor distortion correction](./images/poor_DC.png){width="60%"}

</center>

> This is an issue with certain issues of fMRIprep. Using fMRIprep version 20.2.7 may be needed to avoid the extreme distortion correction (newer versions of fMRIprep haven't been tested)

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

3.  If using already run FreeSurfer `recon-all` output and have specified an `expert-opts` file then fMRIprep shows multiple errors

    -   In the directory that has the prerun `recon-all` there is a folder `scripts` that saves the `expert-opts` file. Removing this file allows fMRIprep to run

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  If fmriprep fails silently (i.e. gives no error) on coregistering the functional to the structural scan, the solution is (if your structural and functional scans are from the same session) to add the following flag:

    `--bold2t1w-init header`

# The next steps

Congratulations, you successfully preprocessed your data and you are one step closer to analyzing your data!
