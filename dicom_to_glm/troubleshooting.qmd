This page is dedicated for Troubleshooting. Known errors and problems will be listed here with a possible solution for solving this issue. If you solved a problem that might be relevant for others as well, feel free to contact Maximilian (,Adam or Natalia) so that it can be added to this page as well.

# General

If you encounter an error

-   Check the error message, maybe copy/paste it to Google/an AI to get a first idea of what is wrong
-   Check if all necessary ressources are sourced (e.g. did you include `ml freesurfer` before [opening a volume to check for noise scans](RemoveNoiseScan.qmd#sec-OpenFreeview))
-   Check if your working directory is set correctly, if not, correct that with `cd /desired/path/` (e.g. [when you try to remove the noise scans](RemoveNoiseScan.qmd#sec-RemoveDenoising))
-   Check if the paths in your command are correct. In some scripts you define you path in a variable, like `$SUBJECTS_DIR` or `$niidir`. If you want to only run a specific line of code separately, you might have to write out the complete path


# [fMRIprep](run_fmriprep.qmd) {#sec-TroublesFmriprep}

## I ran fMRIprep but no distortion correction happened

### Detection of this Problem

#### Error Message

This problem might occur with a corresponding error message (and the fMRIprep command stopping)![Error for IntendedFor Problems](./images/Troubleshooting/OtherIntendedFor_Error.png)

#### Silent error

It can be hard to realize this issue as the output might not be visible anymore, or the problem "occurs silently" (no error message are shown at all).

If the distortion correction was successful, the subject's .html should include a section $B_0$ field mapping. As you can see in the image below, this would be shown at the top of the file where the different sections are listed as well:![.html-File with B0 field mapping](./images/Troubleshooting/missingDistortionCorrection.png)

If the distortion correction failed silently (thus, without an explicit error that is printed somewhere), the section is missing as whole and is not shown at the top of the .html file:![.html file where B0 field mapping is missing](./images/Troubleshooting/MissingDC.png)

### Solution

-   you might be using a wrong BIDS specification in the fmap's `json` file. See [Information about BIDS uri](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common-principles.html#bids-uri), or the [corresponding wiki entry](check_IntendedFor_field.qmd).

-   If the content of the fmap's .json file uses a different naming convention than necessary for your version of [fMRIprep](run_fmriprep.qmd), no distortion correction is applie

$\to$ Follow [this wiki entry](check_IntendedFor_field.qmd) to check and update the entries of the fmap's .json file

## ValueError: Reference passed is not aligned with spline grids

This error sometimes occurs by chance, but should not appear regularly. It is caused by the coregistration algorithm of fmriprep itself. There are two options you can try:

1.  Try a different version of [fMRIprep](run_fmriprep.qmd)

2.  Transform your T1w scan

### Transform your T1w scan

Transforming your T1w scan to avoid this error is not the ideal solution, but it is a good workaround for this complex problem.

To transform your T1w scan:

1.  Load your structural scan in freeview ([identical process as described here for a functional scan](RemoveNoiseScan.qmd#sec-loadVolume))

2.  In the menu-bar in freeview (top-left), select `Tools > Transform Volume...`![Tools \> Transform Volume...](./images/Troubleshooting/Transform_T1w.png)

3.  In the resulting window, select `Transform` in the top menu and change the value in the second "line" (= `Y (P-A)`) to -2.5 (with the slider or enter the number directly). This will shift the T1w scan 2.5mm in the posterior direction. Subsequently, select `Save Volume As`![Shift T1w and save volume](./images/Troubleshooting/Transform_T1w_2.png)

4.  You can simply overwrite the existing T1w file which should already be selected (you could always reverse this step with the described method). **Make sure to select the option** `Do not resample voxel data when saving (only update header)`**!**![Only update header](./images/Troubleshooting/Transform_T1w_3.png)

$\to$ when you run freesurfer with this transformed T1w scan, the "Spline Grid Error" should not occur anymore.

## If using already run FreeSurfer `recon-all` output and have specified an `expert-opts` file then fMRIprep shows multiple errors

$\to$ In the directory that has the prerun `recon-all` there is a folder `scripts` that saves the `expert-opts` file. Removing this file allows fMRIprep to run

## I ran fMRIprep and the distortion correction of the data is too extreme

> This is an issue with certain issues of fMRIprep. Using fMRIprep version 20.2.7 may be needed to avoid the extreme distortion correction (newer versions of fMRIprep haven't been tested)

## fMRIprep fails silently (i.e. gives no error) on coregistering the functional to the structural scan

$\to$ the solution is (if your structural and functional scans are from the same session) to add the following flag:

```         
`--bold2t1w-init header`
```
