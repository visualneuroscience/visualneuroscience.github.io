It can be a good incentive to promote your study by offering participants to give them their T1w files (since everyone knows how cool images of brains are!) **If you promise to give out the T1w-scans to participants, make sure, that you really do it!**

There are only some things to remember:

1.  Since the scans are already defaced when we donÂ´t scan ourself, participants *always* get the defaced T1w scan! Thus, if we acquired the data ourselves (and started with the dicom files) make sure to do the [defacing](defacing.qmd) **before** you send the T1w-file to the participants!

2.  If you provide participants with their T1w scans, it might be a good idea to provide them with the software on how to look at their data! For example, you could point them to MRIcroGL as free tool that they can install themselves to look at their data: [Link to MRIcroGL Download](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl/)

3.  **We do not keep the "non-defaced" T1w scans of participants**! Thus, delete the non-defaced T1w scan of a participant either immediately after [defacing](defacing.qmd), or at the latest after your study finished!

# The next Steps

To continue in your journey to your Analysis, please return to the [Overview-Page](Overview_fromDICOMtoGLM.qmd) to check what to do next.

Alternatively, here is a list of potential next steps to continue with

1.  [Defacing](defacing.qmd)

2.  [Remove Denoising Scans from your data?](RemoveDenoisingScan.qmd)

3.  [fmriprep](run_fmriprep.qmd)
