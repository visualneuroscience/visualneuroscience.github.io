It can be a good incentive to promote your study if you offer participants to give them their T1w files (since everyone knows how cool images of brains are!) **If you promise to give out the T1w-scans to participants, make sure, that you really do it!**

There are only some things to remember:

1.  Participants always get the "faced" T1w scan. If you get the data from the MRI lab directly, there should be a `faced` directory with the files that you can give to the participant. If you started with raw DICOM files, make sure to send the T1w file before [defacing](defacing.qmd) or save defaced image separately!

2.  If you provide participants with their T1w scans, it might be a good idea to provide them with the software on how to look at their data! For example, you could point them to MRIcroGL as a free tool that they can install themselves to look at their data: [Link to MRIcroGL Download](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl/)

3.  **We do not keep the "non-defaced" T1w scans of participants**! Thus, delete the non-defaced T1w scan of a participant either immediately after [defacing](defacing.qmd), or at the latest after your study finished!

# The next Steps

To continue in your journey to your Analysis, please return to the [Overview-Page](Overview_fromDICOMtoGLM.qmd) to check what to do next.

Alternatively, here is a list of potential next steps to continue with

1.  [Defacing](defacing.qmd)

2.  [Check JSON file of the fmap](check_IntendedFor_field.qmd)

3.  [Remove noise scans](RemoveNoiseScan.qmd)

4.  [fmriprep](run_fmriprep.qmd)
