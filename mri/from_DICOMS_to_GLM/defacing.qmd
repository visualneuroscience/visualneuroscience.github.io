To deface your T1w-scan, you first need a T1w nifti file! If you only have DICOM files, please [convert them to nifti's first](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd)!

**Defacing you T1w scans is an important preprocessing step *that has to be done before* [fmriprep](run_fmriprep.qmd). If you run fmriprep without prior defacing, you´ll probably run into errors!**

*Important* (if you [promised participants that they´ll get their T1w scan](ProvidingParticipantsWithTheirT1wFile.qmd): Make sure that you either already have sent the original T1w scan to the participants, or that you have additionally saved it somewhere else!


# Start Pydeface (v.2.0.2) {#sec-startPydeface}

To deface your t1w, you first have to open `pydeface`:

1. Click on the Birds-Symbol at the bottom left

2. Hover `Neurodesk`

3. Hover `All Applications`

4. Scroll down until you find `pydeface`

5. Click on `pydeface 2.0.2`
 ![Pydeface 2.0.2](./images/03_Defacing/01_open_Pydeface.png)

After it opens, it may need some time to load everything - be patient! 

Finally, it should look like this: ![Pydeface Started](./images/03_Defacing/02_pydeface_opened.png)


# Get the path to your original T1w scan

1. Navigate to the anatomical scan of the participant within your [BIDS](DICOMtoBIDS.qmd) directory

2. Right-click on the anatomical nifti file

3. Select `Copy Path(s)
 ![Get Path(s) of anat-scan](./images/03_Defacing/03_Path_to_T1w.png)


# The pydeface command

1. Go back to the terminal window, where pydeface is loaded ([or start it again](#sec-startPydeface))

2. Type `pydeface`

3. Enter the path to your T1w scan (right-click + `paste` or type in the path)

4. Type `--outfile`

5. Repeat Step 3 (with this approach, you "overwrite" the initial T1w with the then defaced T1w file)

6. Type `--force``

It should look like this: ![Pydeface Command](./images/03_Defacing/04_pydeface_command.png)

Then, press enter. Again, it might take a few moments, until pydeface finishes, be patient! At the end, it should look like this: ![Pydeface Finished](./images/03_Defacing/05_defacing_finished.png)


# The next steps

Congratulations, you successfully defaced a T1w-scan and you are one step closer to analyzing your data!

To continue in your journey to your Analysis, please return to the [Overview-Page](Overview_fromDICOMtoGLM.qmd) to check what to do next.

Alternatively, here is a list of potential next steps to continue with

1.  [Remove Denoising Scans from your data?](RemoveDenoisingScan.qmd)

2.  [run fmriprep](run_fmriprep.qmd)
