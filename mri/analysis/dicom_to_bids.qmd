# Documentation

- Documentation related to the conversion of dicoms to BIDS format

- Other programs that can be used to convert dicoms to BIDS 


Going from DICOMS to BIDS datasets (with folder structure):

# Dicoms 

- Dicoms are the raw files that are collected after an MRI session and are aren't too useful to us because analyses use the `.nifti` format

- The script aims to get the dicoms into BIDS format ready for fMRIprep

- The script is intended to be a useful for those first starting an fMRI analysis 


&nbsp;

## Script 

- I created a script [found here](https://github.com/adam-coates/dicom2bids) that carries out the transformation from dicom to BIDS format  

- This is useful because often times we want to convert to BIDS and there are lots of different ways to do this (some more complicated than others) 

- Here I wanted the script to be as easy as possible for a number of reasons but primarily so that anyone can run it (even without using `.json` files)


&nbsp;

## How to use the script

- The script will guide you through the process of converting from dicoms to BIDS

- What's important to know is that the script is not always accurate and will require some input to correct some things

&nbsp;

### 1. Choose the name of the dicom folder in which to convert 

![](./dicom2bids_start.PNG)


&nbsp;

### 2. Optional: If there are subdirectories in the dicom folder (e.g. ses-1 or ses-2) pick one

![](./dicom2bids_subdirs.PNG)

&nbsp;

### 3. Get the name of BIDS subject

![](./dicom2bids_bidsname.PNG)

- What is often the case for us is that the dicoms folder for each participant is named differently to how we want out subject/ BIDS name to be.


&nbsp;

### 4. DICOM search. This will either use pydicom or dcmunpack 
> For some reason pydicom runs a lot faster!!! dcmunpack can take hours but using pydicom can be finished in a few minutes 

- Here the script roughly unpacks all the dicoms ready for the step which renames files and folders and puts the niftis in these new folders

&nbsp;

### 5. Information about the renaming and BIDS conventions 

>pydicom and dcmunpack don't get everything right 100% of the time and the folders/ names of the niftis might be incorrect. This is important as you might want to rename your dicom files into a new name that fits the BIDS format

>The option to delete dicoms is also important, the anat-scout is not crucial for an analysis so theres no need to try to convert it to BIDS

![](./dicom2bids_renameinfo.PNG)

&nbsp;

### 6. Keep/ modify/ delete

> Choose to keep the dicom and the name of the dicom, modify it or delete it (ie don't convert) 

> Any action here will apply to the `.nii.gz` and the `.json`


![](./dicom2bids_keepmodifydelete.PNG)


- If you want to modify the name of the BIDS file then choose modify and rename according to the BIDS naming convention 

![](./dicom2bids_modify.PNG)

&nbsp;

---

- If you want to keep or modify the folder the BIDS file belong to then select either keep or modify 

![](./dicom2bids_foldername_keeprename.PNG)

- Here I want to keep the folder `func` because it is correct


![](./dicom2bids_foldername_rename.PNG)

- Here I want to choose the folder `extra` (this is not a BIDS folder but I want to convert the dicom to a nifti, I'd remove this before fMRIprep)


![](./dicom2bids_foldername_renameanat.PNG)

- Often times the anat folder name is wrong. Here the name should just be `anat`

&nbsp;

### 7. Adding `IntendedFor` field to fmap json

- The conversion does not always add the IntenderFor field to the `.json` in the fmap folder

- For [distortion correction] to take place in fMRIprep it is necessary to add the IntendedFor field to the .json 

- The script uses `jq` to provide the insertion into the fmap .json file

- The format that is added is not BIDS URI compliant but the script will output a text file that can be used to change the intendedfor field with BIDS uri compliant paths.
