The FSFAST glm can be run instead of using [fitlins](link to fitlins)

## Reasons to use FreeSurfers FSFAST

- If fitlins does not have a particular option for you that you would like to use i.e. different 

- Potentially easier when working with surface space data (FSFAST was originally designed for surface space data)


&nbsp;

## Neurodesk

### What does a container mean

- Neurodesk has a whole host of software that is available for us to use

- Neurodesk works in which each piece of software has its own container 

- Simply put for us this means that we use 1 piece of software that is contained inside its own environment


![Example of what containers mean](./neurodesk_eg.png){fig-align="center"}


- So for the example above if you were inside of the [FreeSurfer]{style="background-color: #ffc9c9;"} container the only available software to you would be FreeSurfer 

- [MATLAB]{style="background-color: #ffec99;"}, [fMRIprep]{style="background-color: #b2f2bb;"} and  [SPM]{style="background-color: #d0bfff;"} would not be available to you

## Note: MATLAB runtime environment

However, FreeSurfer uses something called a **MATLAB runtime environment** 

- MATLAB runtime environment is a way in which you can use FreeSurfer commands without having MATLAB directly installed

## FreeSurfer commands that do rely on the MATLAB runtime environment 


- Sometimes when running FreeSurfer commands on neurodesk you might run into an error like so: 

![](./freesurfer_matlab_error.PNG){fig-align="center"}


- What this means is the following: 

    1. FreeSurfer by default is looking for a whole MATLAB installation 

    2. FreeSurfer does not know whether there is a MATLAB runtime environment

        > This is because the MATLAB runtime environment is installed in a folder somewhere
   


&nbsp;

## Steps to run FreeSurfer commands

**1. Start a FreeSurfer container:**


![](./start_freesurfer.PNG){fig-align="center"}


&nbsp; 


**2. Set up your environment variables:**

- When using FreeSurfer it's important to tell FreeSurfer where to find the subjects directory (SUBJECTS_DIR) 

> (see [FreeSurfers FSFAST tutorial](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsFastTutorialV5.1/FsFastFirstLevel) for more information)


For example: 

`export SUBJECTS_DIR=$TUTORIAL_DATA/buckner_data/tutorial_subjs`


&nbsp;

**3. Change directory to where your data is:**

For example: 

`cd data`


&nbsp;

**4. Try and run the command first:**

For example:

`Freeview` ← this doesn't rely on MATLAB so the freeview window should open


`recon-all` ← this doesn't rely on MATLAB either so should work


`mri_vol2vol` ← this doesn't rely on MATLAB so should also work



`mkcontrast-sess` ← this does rely on MATLAB runtime environment


&nbsp;

**5. What to do if your command doesn't work?**


If you run a command for example:

`mkcontrast-sess -analysis auditory_v_baseline.sm0   -contrast a_vs_base -a 2 -c 1`

And then see an error like so:

![](./freesurfer_matlab_error.PNG){#fig-error}


- This means that FreeSurfer doesn't know where the MATLAB runtime environment is therefore run the following: 


`export FS_MCRROOT=/opt/MCR2019b/v97/`


**The command above is important to tell FreeSurfer where the MATLAB runtime environment is**

&nbsp;

**6. Re-run the command again**


> If you fall into the error as above @fig-error : then run the command using `-mcr 1`

For example: 

`mkcontrast-sess -analysis auditory_v_baseline.sm0   -contrast a_vs_base -a 2 -c 1 -mcr 1`
