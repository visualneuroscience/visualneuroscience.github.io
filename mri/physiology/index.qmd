## *Acquistion of log-files:*

### *Physiology logging:*

-   Press tab + \[-\> + Entf to enter admin mode
-   PMU control
-   control-esc
-   run -\> cmd
-   in the terminal, type ideacmdtool
-   DON'T use startLogAll, start puls and ECG separately (if both are started simultaneously, recording will terminate after 5 min.)
-   After a while there should be a message with “ok” at the end
-   Data is stored in `C:\ProgramFiles\Siemens\Numaris\ Mars\log\` (there is a shortcut “log” in the Explorer )
-   Stop recording after experiment with stopLogAll, move data to `C:\_Natalia\STUDYNAME`

## *Required:*

-   Json- files of functional data for each run
-   Physiology log-files, one for all runs (.resp and .puls files)

-   Script: `/storage/nv_shared/PhysIO_excitex/PhysIO_get_regressors.m`

## *Before running the script:*

-   Always check if on path: SPM: `/usr/local/spm12/` Toolbox-code modified for our scanner model: `/storage/nv_shared/software/PhysIO/tapas-master/PhysIO/code`

-   Individual parameter settings in the script:

    -   `physio.log_files.vendor` = 'Siemens_xa20'; % specific for our scanner model.
    -   `physio.log_files.resp_type` = 'spine'; % set to spine or belt, depending on type of physiology correction.
    -   `physio.model.orthogonalise` = 'RETROICOR'; % select depending on physiology model used, e.g. 'RETROICOR', or c, r; to avoid correlations between regressors.
    -   `physio.model.retroicor.include` = true; % select physiology model here: RETROICOR, RVT or HVT.
    -   `physio.model.retroicor.order.c` = 3;
    -   `physio.model.retroicor.order.r` = 4;
    -   `physio.model.retroicor.order.cr` = 1; % select orders for RETROICOR model; here the default option based on Glover et al., 2000 is set.
    -   `physio.model.rvt.include` = false; % select physiology model here.
    -   `physio.model.hrv.include` = false; % select physiology model here.
    -   `physio.model.other.include` = false; % select physiology model here.
    -   `physio.verbose.level` = 3; % 2 or 3, will produce control plots – useful to check quality of data and if synchronization has worked; when analyzing several participants it’s best to set to 0.

## *After running the script:*

-   Validation of results - Check the diagnostic plots the toolbox delivers:
    -   Check the raw time series for artifacts/ detachments (4A)
    -   Check distribution of raw physiological data (should be left-skewed, 4B), are there any indications for ceiling effects or temporary detachment (2)?\
    -   Check period used for synchronization, does it fit? (4C)
    -   Check filtered time series (are there still severe artifacts?)
    -   Check regressor file (3): regressors should have a value for each slice and 18 regressors if you specified RETROICOR (i.e., 6 cardiac phase regressors, 8 respiratory phase regressors, and 4 interaction terms).
    -   Regressors can then be added to a GLM.
