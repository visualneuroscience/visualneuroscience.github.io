    "text": "Vision tests\n\n\nPrescreening tests\nBefore starting any experiment with a subject, confirm that they have “normal vision” since it is a critical exclusion criteria for most of the studies in vision science. ## Visual acuity According to the World Heath Organization (WHO), “visual acuity is … a simple, non-invasive measure and critical to determine the presence of vision impairment” [1]. The vision impairment is an eye condition which causes imperfections in the function of visual system [2]. We use visual acuity tests to quantify how acurately the visual system perceives the outer world.\nIn our lab, we perform FrACT10 to measure the visual acuity. The subjects having mild impairment or worse are excluded based on the scores of FrACT10. The threshold for exclusion is 0.40 logMAR or 0.4 decVA [3]. ## Stereoacuity Stereopsis is also an important phenomenon for binocular rivalry since it is based on binocular disparity [4]. Therefore, the subjects who has a stereoacuity less than 30arcsec are considered as having poor stereovision and mostly excluded from binocular rivalry experiments [5]. We use Random Dot V test with red cyan anaglyph glasses to quantify the stereopsis.\nThe difficulty of the test increases while the number on the test window decreases. Considering the distance from the screen, our threshold is level 3. So, the subject should perceive 3D shape on Random Dot V test at least level 3 and above. ## Parameters that we use FrACT10: Test when both eyes are open and then, when only one eye open (left and right seperately). You may train the subject before testing because it is not so straight-forward for some people. - acuity_task                  4-step Landolt-Cs - unit                          VAdec (1.0+) & LogMAR(&lt;0) - lengthOfCalibrationRuler   173.0 - distanceInCm               230.0 - maxDecimalAcuity         2.41 - contrastWeber             100.0 - nTrials                       24 - rangeLimitStatus           rangeOK - crowding                   0\n\nthreshold                   logMAR =&lt; 0.4\n\nRandom Dot V: The first number at the right bottom corner of test window indicates the level of difficulty.

When you move the cursor outside of the test window, the stimulus is regenereted.\nThe second number at the right bottom corner of test window indicates the orientation of the letter V.

    "text": "Stereoacuity\nStereopsis is also an important phenomenon for binocular rivalry since it is based on binocular disparity [4]. Therefore, the subjects who has a stereoacuity less than 30arcsec are considered as having poor stereovision and mostly excluded from binocular rivalry experiments [5]. We use Random Dot V test with red cyan anaglyph glasses to quantify the stereopsis.\nThe difficulty of the test increases while the number on the test window decreases. Considering the distance from the screen, our threshold is level 3. So, the subject should perceive 3D shape on Random Dot V test at least level 3 and above."

    "text": "For luminance measurement on a certain screen (output screen), two monitors and a spectrophotometer are required. The Psychtoolbox script is run on the primary display monitor, while the luminance of the output screen is being measured. For the measurement, you need to stabilize the photometer on chinrest or anywhere in fromt of the output screen. In the worst case, a second person can hold the photometer at a constant distance. With the Script, 17 different levels of luminance for each of the three colors (R, G, B) and for all three colors together (grey), respectively, are displayed on the output screen. The luminance measures are typed into the command window. When the script is run without an error, it automatically saves the 17 values into a mat-file. Importantly, the room in which luminance is measured has to be as dark as possible.
