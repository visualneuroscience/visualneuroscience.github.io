It was developed by Franz Faul at the Universität Kiel, Germany, and is frequently updated and improved upon. The software is designed to help researchers with a variety of statistical tests, including t-tests, F-tests, chi-squared tests, z-tests, and some exact tests.\n\nGPower provides a flexible tool for calculating the required sample size for a study based on the effect size, significance level, and power – which refers to the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. Researchers can also use G*Power to calculate the power of their study given the sample size and effect size.\n\nThe program is user-friendly, allowing both beginners and experienced users to carry out a range of power analyses that might otherwise be complex and time-consuming. Its broad applicability across various statistical analyses makes it a valuable tool in the research planning process, helping to ensure that studies are properly designed to yield valid and reliable results.\nSee official page of G*Power"

    "text": "How to calculate a priori sample size\nTo calculate an a priori sample size using G*Power, you need to follow several steps. The specific steps might change slightly depending on the statistical test you plan to use, but the overall process is similar:\n\nDownload and Open G*Power\nChoose the Test\nIn the G*Power interface, select the statistical test that you intend to use from the ‘Test family’ (e.g., t tests, F tests, etc.) and the ‘Statistical test’ (e.g., ANOVA, linear multiple regression, etc.) menus according to the hypothesis of your study.\nDetermine the Type of Power Analysis\nSince you want to calculate the sample size, you should choose ‘A priori: Compute required sample size - given α, power, and effect size’.\nInput Parameters\n\nEffect Size: Estimate the effect size for your desired test, which indicates the magnitude of the relationship or difference that you expect to find. You can use previous literature or pilot studies to estimate this.\nα Error Probability (Significance Level): Typically, this is set at 0.05.\nPower (1-β Error Probability): Commonly set at 0.80, indicating an 80% chance of detecting an effect if there really is one.\nAllocation Ratio (for comparative studies): This is the ratio of the number of participants in one group to the number of participants in the other group(s). For equal group sizes, this is set to 1.\n\nCalculate\nOnce all parameters are entered, click on the ‘Calculate’ button. G*Power will display the required sample size for your study based on the input values.\nReview Output\nG*Power will provide the calculated sample size along with other details related to the power analysis. Carefully review this output to determine if it is suitable for the needs of your study.\n\nKeep in mind that determining these parameters, especially the effect size, can sometimes be the most challenging part of a power analysis. Consult with a statistician, your team members or relevant literature if you are unsure about these inputs. Finally, remember that power analysis is an important part of designing your study, but it should be combined with practical considerations like resource availability, ethical constraints, and methodological limitations.\n\nCalculating a priori sample size for a repeated measures ANOVA\nAs an example, let’s say we have 3 different stimulus types. In each session, we will present one type of stimuli at 4 different contrast levels. The task will be the same throughout the experiment. Our aim is to determine the effect of contrast.\nIn such a case, we need using a repeated measures ANOVA (or 2-way mixed ANOVA or split-plot ANOVA). Calculating an a priori sample size for a mixed-design ANOVA in GPower can be a bit tricky, as GPower does not directly provide a pre-built module for mixed ANOVAs with both within- (repeated measures) and between-subjects factors. However, you can still approximate the necessary calculations by considering the most powerful test within your design, which is typically the repeated measures part if the effect sizes are similar. Here is a general guide on how to do this:\n\nOpen G*Power\nSelect the Statistical Test\n\nChoose ‘F tests’ as the test family.\nChoose ‘ANOVA: Repeated measures, within factors’.\n(You can also choose ‘ANOVA: Repeated measures, between factors’ depending on which effect you expect to be larger or more important to your hypothesis testing. However, a conservative approach is often to consider the within-effects when uncertain.)\n\nChoose the Type of Power Analysis\n\nSelect ‘A priori: Compute required sample size - given α, power, and effect size’.\n\nInput the Parameters\n\nEffect Size: We need to determine the effect size with direct method to count the effect of repeated measure. To do that, click on ‘Determine =)&gt;’. On the pop-up window, select ‘Direct’. Enter eta squared value. Click ‘Calculate and transfer to main window’.\nEta squared (\\(\\eta^{2}\\)) is the effect size that indicates the total variance in testing explained by the within-subject variable (in our case, different contrast levels). Approximate partial eta squared conventions are small = 0.02, medium = 0.06, large = 0.14.\nα Error Probability: The significance level is typically set at 0.05.\nPower: Set this commonly to 0.80, indicating an 80% probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis.\nNumber of Groups: For the between-subjects factor, input the number of levels or conditions. In our case, it is the number of different stimuli.\nNumber of Measurements: For the within-subjects factor, input the number of levels or conditions. In our case, it is the number of different contrast levels.\nCorrelation among Repeated Measures: This is determined by the expected correlation between the measures at different levels of contrast. If you don’t have an estimate, using a default value like 0.5 can be a starting point.\nNonsphericity Correction ε: If you have an estimate for this, input it here; otherwise, you can keep it at 1 or use the default provided by G*Power.\n\nCalculate\nReview Results\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that this approach is an approximation, as it does not fully represent the complexity of a mixed-design ANOVA. It essentially treats the between-subjects factor as another within-subjects level, which may not be totally accurate but can give you a ballpark figure for your sample size. If possible, consult with a statistician to ensure that the calculation is correctly tailored to your study’s specific needs and to take into account other complexities that G*Power may not directly address for mixed designs.\nSee another example on YouTube"
